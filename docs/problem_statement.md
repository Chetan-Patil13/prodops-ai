Operational data exists across SQL databases, reports, and documents

Supervisors manually:

Query SSMS

Open Excel files

Create tickets

Inform teams via calls/WhatsApp

No single interface for:

Understanding production health

Acting on issues

Dashboards are passive (read-only, no actions)

Context is lost between shifts

Key Insight (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

The problem is not lack of data, but lack of an intelligent action layer.
